**Turn physics equations into quantum computer programs**

---

## What Does This Do?

Scientists use mathematical equations called Hamiltonians to describe how physical systems change over time, whether that's electrons in a molecule, magnets interacting, or particles in extreme conditions. Quantum computers could simulate these systems much faster than regular computers, but they need very specific step-by-step instructions to do so. Writing these instructions by hand is incredibly tedious and error-prone, like writing machine code instead of using a modern programming language.

HamiltonianCompiler solves this problem by automatically translating physics equations into optimized quantum computer instructions. It's like a smart translator that understands both the language of physics and the language of quantum computers. The tool includes several clever algorithms that figure out the best way to translate your specific problem, then optimize the result to run as efficiently as possible on real quantum hardware. This can make programs run twenty to forty percent faster than basic translation methods.

Whether you're a chemist studying new molecules for drug development, a physicist exploring magnetic materials, or a researcher investigating fundamental questions about nature, this tool handles the complex translation work automatically. You describe your system the natural way physicists do, and the compiler takes care of turning that into a program a quantum computer can run. It comes complete with examples, extensive testing to ensure reliability, and detailed documentation to help you get started.
